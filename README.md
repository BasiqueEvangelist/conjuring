## Overview

Conjuring adds a customizable Mob Spawner, the Conjurer, as well as a fully-featured tool set, the Soul Alloy Tools, which all share some sort of special ability. 
Each stat of the Conjurer can be upgraded, and in much the same way each one of the tools can be enhanced for better performance in different areas.
