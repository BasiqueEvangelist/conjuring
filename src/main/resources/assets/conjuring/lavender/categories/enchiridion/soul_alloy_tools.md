It turns out that [Soul Alloy](^conjuring:basics/soul_composite_materials) makes for formidable tools when 
applied on top of {light_purple}Netherite{} using a [Soul Weaver](^conjuring:rituals/ritual_of_weaving). What these
implements can accomplish and how they may be refined is outlined in these pages.


To avoid possible confusion when operating the tools, it is highly recommended to 
read up on [Basic Tool Safety](^conjuring:soul_alloy_tools/tool_safety).
