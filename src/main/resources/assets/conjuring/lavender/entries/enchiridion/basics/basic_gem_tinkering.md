The {light_purple}Gem Tinkerer{} is a very special kind of runic apparatus required to create {gold}Aspect Gems{}.
These little stones each express a different facet of customization, all of which can be applied to most implements
bearing [Soul Alloy](^conjuring:basics/soul_composite_materials).


The 4 different gems are made of these materials: {light_purple}Redstone{}, {light_purple}Lapis Lazuli{},

{light_purple}Eye of Ender{} or {light_purple}Emerald{}. To operate the {light_purple}Gem Tinkerer{}, one must first place some
[Lesser Conjuration Essence](^conjuring:basics/conjuration_essence#3) on top. All hovering columns then
need to be fitted with the desired items. Finally, a simple {gold}shift-right-click{} with an {gold}empty hand{}
will initiate the crafting process.

The violent conditions inside a [Conjurer](^conjuring:basics/conjurer) necessitate extra care when trying to use
{light_purple}Aspect Gems{} inside one. In fact, reinforcing them using {light_purple}Gem Sockets{} is required.
These sturdy little receptacles allow the {light_purple}Gems{} to focus their energy directly into the installed
[Conjuring Focus](^conjuring:basics/conjuring_focus), augmenting its capabilities.
