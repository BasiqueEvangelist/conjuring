While being the most basic substance involved in summoning, {light_purple}Conjuration Essence{} is still of 
utmost importance. It embodies the most basic properties all souls share and is therefore involved in the creation of 
many more capable materials.

;;;;;

One can obtain some essence of their own from {gold}breaking ordinary spawners{} as well as {gold}plundering chests{}.

For when a less concentrated material is required, simply {gold}sneak-right-clicking{} some essence on any stone-like 
surface smashes it into 4 pieces of {light_purple}Lesser Conjuration Essence{}
