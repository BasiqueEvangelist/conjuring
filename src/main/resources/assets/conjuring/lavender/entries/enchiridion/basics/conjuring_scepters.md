Commanding the powerful contraptions involved in conjuration is no easy task and as such, the 
{light_purple}Conjuring Scepter{} is required to interact with most of them. The very basic act of mounting a 
{light_purple}Diamond{} onto a {light_purple}Blaze Rod{} has apparently greatly improved their magical abilities, 
making the usage of most runic machinery a breeze.

There may come a point at which one runs out of [Conjuration Essence](^conjuring:basics/conjuration_essence). 
When this happens, many options can be explored, yet the {light_purple}Superior Conjuring Scepter{} should prove the 
most reliable long-term solution. By utilizing the innate mystical properties of the attached 
{light_purple}Nether Star{}, it manages to create so-called {gold}Soul Projectiles{}. These will condense an entity's 
soul into some [Conjuration Essence](^conjuring:basics/conjuration_essence) when on sufficiently low health.

Additionally, the scepter is capable of instantly finishing any process in the 
[Soulfire Forge](^conjuring:basics/soulfire_forge) by {gold}shift-right-clicking{}.
