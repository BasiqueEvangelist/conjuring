To start out in the practice of conjuration, a basic supply of {light_purple}Netherite Scrap{} and some 
[Conjuration Essence](^conjuring:basics/conjuration_essence) is required. The first piece of equipment one shall create 
is the [Soulfire Forge](^conjuring:basics/soulfire_forge), required to form the elementary
[Soul Composite Materials](^conjuring:basics/soul_composite_materials). Moving forward, constructing a 
[Conjurer](^conjuring:basics/conjurer) as well as a [Conjuring Scepter](^conjuring:basics/conjuring_scepters) and 
[Conjuring Focus](^conjuring:basics/conjuring_focus) is in order.

Once this gear has been obtained, it is recommended to brush up on [Ritual Basics](^conjuring:rituals/ritual_basics) 
and seek to perform the [Ritual of Extraction](^conjuring:rituals/ritual_of_extraction) to create a first summoning 
setup. This may be refined using the practices outlined in [Basic Gem Tinkering](^conjuring:basics/basic_gem_tinkering).
After having gained some experience with souls, creating {gold}Soul Alloy Tools{} may be of interest. 

;;;;;

These prestigious instruments can be enhanced through 
[Advanced Gem Tinkering](^conjuring:soul_alloy_tools/advanced_gem_tinkering). Crafting them however, requires 
the [Ritual of Weaving](^conjuring:rituals/ritual_of_weaving) to be carried out.
