Many of the materials involved in conjuration and related activities aren't exactly what one might consider *safe* or 
*easy to work with*. Especially {light_purple}Soul Soil{}, because of the very properties exploited in the creation of 
{light_purple}Soul Alloy{}, can be quite nasty.


To remedy this, the {light_purple}Soulfire Forge{} is employed when working with these

substances. By utilizing {gold}Soul Fire{}, it can burn off dangerous or unwanted components and create a 
clean composite.


This consumes the {gold}Soul Fire{} however, meaning that re-lighting it for every crafting process is required.

This would seem a menial task, yet, some well-known basic dispensing machinery can be used to handle it.


Taking all these precautions for safety also incurs a time penalty that increases with recipe complexity, something only advanced equipment may mitigate.
