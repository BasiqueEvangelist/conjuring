A [Conjuring Focus](^conjuring:basics/conjuring_focus) does a good job, but sometimes it is simply not enough. 
A {light_purple}Stabilized Conjuring Focus{}, which is reinforced with 
[Soul Slices](^conjuring:basics/soul_composite_materials), is exponentially more powerful. Once inserted into a 
[Conjurer](^conjuring:basics/conjurer), it will start mimicking a player's presence, practically allowing for 
perpetual summoning.

Considering how expensive a Stabilized Focus is, cleaning and reusing it might seem practical. To accomplish this, 
one can utilize {light_purple}Distilled Spirit{}. This freakish fluid is obtained by imbuing four pieces of
[Conjuration Essence](^conjuring:basics/conjuration_essence)

;;;;;

into a plain old glass bottle using a [Soul Weaver](^conjuring:rituals/ritual_of_weaving). The focus to be cleansed
must then be placed into a {light_purple}Soul Funnel{} and the {light_purple}Distilled Spirit{} dropped on top. 
Finally, a simple {gold}right-click{} with a [Conjuring Scepter](^conjuring:basics/conjuring_scepters) will 
suffice to extract the soul.
