Seeing as {light_purple}Gilded Blackstone{} has some peculiar magical properties, it seems perfectly reasonable to
construct a pedestal out of it. These have been proven to excel at presenting items and providing their essence,
enabling the performing of {gold}rituals{}. Prior to this, however, the pedestals {gold}need to be linked{} to the
respective ritual's core.

This is accomplished by {gold}shift-right-clicking{} first a pedestal and then the corresponding ritual core, all
while wielding a [Conjuring Scepter](^conjuring:basics/conjuring_scepters) of any kind.
