Knowing how to perform the {gold}Ritual of Extraction{} is easily one of the most important skills involved in
summoning. This potent practice brutally siphons an entity's soul into a provided
[Conjuring Focus](^conjuring:basics/conjuring_focus).


A process inherently unsafe, without pedestals only {gold}one tenth{} of attempts is said to succeed.

;;;;;

To begin, one must place a {light_purple}Soul Funnel{} and fill it with both {light_purple}Soul Sand{} and a
[Conjuring Focus](^conjuring:basics/conjuring_focus). As an optional step, four pedestals may now be placed and linked
to the funnel as described in [Ritual Basics](^conjuring:rituals/ritual_basics). These will be used to stabilize the
ritual by providing samples of the entity's essence, supplied in the form of an {gold}item the entity is known to drop{}.
Having four of these present and executing the ritual in a {gold}Soul Sand Valley{} reportedly guarantees success.

;;;;;

Once everything has been prepared, the entity shall be lured on the funnel. This will make it possible to commence
the ritual by {gold}right-clicking{} the {light_purple}Soul Funnel{} with a
[Conjuring Scepter](^conjuring:basics/conjuring_scepters).
