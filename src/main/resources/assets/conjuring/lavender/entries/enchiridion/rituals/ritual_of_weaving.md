Some crafting processes, like those involved in fabricating [Soul Alloy Tools](^conjuring:soul_alloy_tools/basics), 
can be very involved and consequently require the {gold}Ritual of Weaving{} to be carried out.


To get started, one ought place a {light_purple}Soul Weaver{} and link it to four pedestals as depicted in 
[Ritual Basics](^conjuring:rituals/ritual_basics). Then, the crafting ingredients must be placed

on both weaver and pedestals. In the final step, the {light_purple}Soul Weaver{} has to be loaded with 
[Conjuration Essence](^conjuring:basics/conjuration_essence) and subsequently {gold}right-clicked{} with a 
[Conjuring Scepter](^conjuring:basics/conjuring_scepters) to commence the ritual.
