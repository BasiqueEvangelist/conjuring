After priming on [Basic Gem Tinkering](^conjuring:basics/basic_gem_tinkering), one might realize the
{light_purple}Gem Tinkerer{}'s *full potential*. Upon acquiring some {light_purple}Soul Alloy Tools{}, it can infuse
them with [Aspect Gems](^conjuring:basics/basic_gem_tinkering). This procedure is remarkably similar to normal
operation, as one must simply substitute the {light_purple}Lesser Conjuration Essence{} with the tool and the items
on the columns with the desired gems.

Yet, there is a limit to this power. A single tool may only carry two gem types, and never more than 5 gems.
