The perilous {light_purple}Soul Alloy Pickaxe{} is worth more than your average, puny {light_purple}Netherite Pickaxe{}.
{gold}Right-clicking{} will coerce it to send out a beam which vein-mines any ores it touches. Applying the various 
[Aspect Gems](^conjuring:basics/basic_gem_tinkering) onto a {light_purple}Soul Alloy Pickaxe{} will affect 
it in a plethora of ways:

- {#007a18}≈ Haste: Improves the pace of mining with the pickaxe. Stacks with Efficiency.{}

- {#a80f01}ღ Abundance: Increases the amount dropped by certain ores. Stacks with Fortune.{}\
- {#4d8184}λ Scope: Quite literally increases the scope of mining. Increases by 1 block per gem.{}\
- {#123f89}ʊ Ignorance: Ignores a small amount of durability loss when using the tool. Stacks with Unbreaking.{}
