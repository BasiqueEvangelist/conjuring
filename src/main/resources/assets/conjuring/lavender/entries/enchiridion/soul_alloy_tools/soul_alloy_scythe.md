Tending to a field can be a laborious task, especially when it comes to the larger one. The
{light_purple}Soul Alloy Scythe{} offers itself as the perfect solution. By serving both as a capable cutting
apparatus as well as a remote reaping rig, it can diminish Potatoes and similar plant matter incredibly quickly.
It may be upgraded using [Aspect Gems](^conjuring:basics/basic_gem_tinkering) in these ways:

;;;;;

- {#007a18}≈ Haste: Improves the swiftness of swinging the Scythe.{}\
- {#a80f01}ღ Abundance: Might lead to finding more needles in haystacks or seeds in crops. Stacks with Fortune.{}\
- {#4d8184}λ Scope: Increases the reach of the Soul Harvesting ability.{}

;;;;;

- {#123f89}ʊ Ignorance: Ignores a small amount of durability loss when using the tool, stacks with Unbreaking. Also makes
  the Soul Harvester ignore crops which haven't yet reached maturity.{}
