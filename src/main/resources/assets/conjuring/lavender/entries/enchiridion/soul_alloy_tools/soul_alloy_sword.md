The Soul Alloy Sword is a contribution to the warrior who possess it. Its ability launches five beams, which normally 
deal 20% of that sword's attack damage each. If one wishes to make the {light_purple}Soul Alloy Sword{} stronger, then 
the art of [Gem Tinkering](^conjuring:basics/basic_gem_tinkering) will strengthen it so:

- {#007a18}≈ Haste: Improves the speed of swinging the sword.{}

;;;;;


- {#a80f01}ღ Abundance: Rewards the killer with larger spoils when eradicating an enemy. Stacks with Looting.{}\
- {#4d8184}λ Scope: Disables Sweeping Edge in favor of a large area of effect attack. The damage this deals increases 
  with each gem fitted. {}\
- {#123f89}ʊ Ignorance: Ignores a specific amount of armor per gem fitted.{}
