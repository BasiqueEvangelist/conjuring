The powers resting inside {gold}Soul Alloy Tools{} are formidable. Whether innate like the
[Soul Alloy Hatchet](^conjuring:soul_alloy_tools/soul_alloy_hatchet)'s {gold}Soul Feller{} ability or additive like
the {gold}area-mining{} of a scope-augmented [Soul Alloy Pickaxe](^conjuring:soul_alloy_tools/soul_alloy_pickaxe), they
can also be quite destructive. To ensure one's property stays intact, the tools normally rest in a disabled state,
ready to be awoken by their master.

To accomplish this, it is required to press both the {gold}Shift{} and {gold}<keybind;key.conjuring.toggle_tool_mode>{}
(configurable) keys while holding the tool.
